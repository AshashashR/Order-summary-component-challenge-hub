# Frontend Mentor - Stats preview card component solution

This is a solution to the [Stats preview card component challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/stats-preview-card-component-8JqbgoU62). 

And this is my second attempt doing it ! After receiving feedback on my first attempt, I managed to fix everything (responsivity, background issues)

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

On my first attempt, I didn't use CSS Flexbox so the design was kind of weird. I tried to fix it by modifying margin and padding etc. Which was really time consuming !!

With my second attempt, I used flexbox and applied the advices I've been given on Frontend Mentor. My code is cleaner and much simpler than the first attempt.


### Continued development

I will need to keep practicing Flexbox, since I was not really used to it.

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://vanzaordersummary.netlify.app/) - This helped me for giving me a concrete visual example fo the card.
